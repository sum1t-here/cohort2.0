Store : The store is a single source of truth that holds the entire state of the application. It is typically created using the createStore function provided by Redux.

Reducers: Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. Each reducer takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns the new state. Reducers are combined into a single root reducer using the combineReducers function provided by Redux.

State: The state represents the current state of the application stored in the Redux store. It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed directly. Instead, changes to the state are made by dispatching actions.

Actions: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent an intention to change the state. They contain a type field that describes the type of action being performed and additional data if needed. Actions are dispatched using the dispatch function.

Dispatch: Dispatch is a function provided by Redux that is used to send actions to the store. When an action is dispatched, Redux passes it to the root reducer, which then determines how the state should change based on the action type.

Selectors: Selectors are functions used to extract specific pieces of state from the Redux store. They can be used to compute derived state or to retrieve data from nested state objects.

Provider: The Provider is a React component provided by the react-redux library that makes the Redux store available to the entire component tree. It should be placed at the root of the component tree to ensure that all components have access to the Redux store.
